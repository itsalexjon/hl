<h3><strong>Is Apple Pay accepted at Hobby Lobby?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might wonder if you can use Apple Pay for your crafting haul if you're an Apple Pay user at Hobby Lobby. Unfortunately, you cannot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it may come as a surprise to some, Hobby Lobby has a unique take on technology. Their conservative values and focus on traditional methods may make them wary of adopting newer methods such as Apple Pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobby Lobby customers may not be able to use Apple Pay, but there are still plenty of convenient payment options available:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All major credit and debit cards are accepted, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Hobby Lobby gift card can be a great way to budget for projects and make a great gift for fellow hobbyists.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can always pay with cash at Hobby Lobby.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you can't use your iPhone to pay, Hobby Lobby still offers a seamless shopping experience.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact Hobby Lobby directly and ask them to offer Apple Pay.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is certain that one thing remains constant: the crafting community is united and strong. As we express our preferences and support each other, we can make sure our favorite stores accept our preferred payment methods.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Is Hobby Lobby not accepting Apple Pay or Google Pay?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a number of reasons, Hobby Lobby has not integrated contactless payment methods. In addition to the cost of updating their point-of-sale system to support contactless payments, training staff on new payment methods can be time consuming, which can temporarily disrupt store operations. Due to their many digital payment options like PayPal, Hobby Lobby may not need to incorporate Apple Pay and Google Pay into their online platform. Here are some details to consider:</span></p>
<h3><strong>PayPal:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Hobby Lobby customers already have PayPal accounts, so Apple Pay and Google Pay are no longer relevant. PayPal is already integrated into Hobby Lobby's online store.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Costly upgrades:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobby Lobby would have to overhaul its checkout equipment in order to accept Apple Pay.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Training:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing Apple Pay training for cashiers can also be time-consuming and challenging.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Future prospects</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Hobby Lobby does not currently support Google Pay or Apple Pay, the retail landscape is constantly evolving. In the near future, Hobby Lobby may have to reevaluate its payment strategy to meet the demands of its tech-savvy customers as contactless payment options become more popular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, Hobby Lobby shoppers should consider alternative digital solutions whenever possible.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Hobby Lobby's operating hours explained</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the Hobby Lobby hours if you're planning to visit</span></p>
<h3><strong>Following are the typical operating hours:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday through Saturday, Hobby Lobby locations open at 9:00 AM and close at 8:00 PM. However, store hours are subject to change, so be sure to call ahead.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Knowing the closing time is important</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing a store's closing time is essential for those who work late or have other obligations throughout the day.</span></p>
